## Implementing various data structures and common algorithms in JavaScript and TypeScript
I will try to implement various data structures and common algorithms in JavaScript, including:
* LinkedList (both Single and double)
* Queue
* Stack
* Hash Tables
* Trees
  * Binary Trees
  * AVL Trees
  * Heaps
  * Tries
* Graphs
* Sorting Algorithms
* Searching Algorithms

From my experience in C#, some of those data structures and algorithms are much easier to implement in strictly-typed languages like Java or C#. Infact, languages have built-in support for some of the common data structures.
Javascript is kinda a wierd language and things are done differently. 
I will also implement both the Javascript and TypeScript to show you why you should always prefer Typescript when possible.
